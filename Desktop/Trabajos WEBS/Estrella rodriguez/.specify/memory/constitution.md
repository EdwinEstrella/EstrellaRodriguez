# Estrella Rodriguez Constitution

## Core Principles

### Screaming Architecture
The project structure must clearly communicate that this is an educational task room website, not a technology showcase. File organization, naming conventions, and directory hierarchy must reflect the educational domain and user needs rather than technical implementation details.

### Vanilla Web Technologies
HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript are the only permitted technologies. No frameworks, libraries, or build tools allowed. The project must use a unified architecture without frontend/backend separation - all functionality exists within static files that can be served directly.

### Educational User Experience
Design must be colorful, cheerful, and appropriate for educational contexts with children and young users. All interactions require smooth entrance and exit animations that are eye-catching yet professional. The interface must be fully responsive for mobile and tablet devices with intuitive navigation patterns.

### SEO Excellence
Complete search engine optimization is mandatory with comprehensive meta tags, semantic HTML5 structure, and proper sitemap implementation. All content must be accessible and indexable by search engines with proper heading hierarchy and descriptive markup.

### Code Quality & Maintainability
All code must be clean, well-commented, and easily maintainable. Implementation should follow web standards and best practices with clear separation of concerns. Code must be human-readable and comprehensible without external documentation dependencies.

### Performance Optimization
Fast loading times and smooth 60fps animations are required. All images must be optimized, resources minified where appropriate, and loading strategies implemented to ensure excellent user experience across all devices and network conditions.

## Technology Stack

**Frontend**: HTML5 (semantic markup), CSS3 (modern features, Grid, Flexbox, animations), Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
**Backend**: None (static site architecture)
**Build Tools**: None (direct file serving)
**Deployment**: Static hosting compatible

## Quality Standards

**Code Standards**: Valid HTML5, CSS3 compliance, JavaScript lint-ready, comprehensive comments
**Design Standards**: Responsive design, accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA, cross-browser compatibility
**Performance Standards**: Lighthouse score >90, <3s initial load, 60fps animations
**SEO Standards**: Meta tags complete, structured data, sitemap.xml, robots.txt

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and requirements. All development work must comply with these principles without exception. Amendments require documentation of changes, approval justification, and migration plan for affected code. Each feature implementation must be verified against these principles before completion.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-11-03 | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-03
